        <h1>Intro questions</h1>
        <ol>
         <li><strong>Name, major, year in school: </strong>Cindy Zhou, majoring in Communication design, I am a junior this year.</li> 
         <li><strong>Background and why this class: </strong>I am minoring in HCI and really enjoy drawing as well. I think learning a design-focused coding class is a very important experience and understanding the website deisgn.</li>
         <li><strong>Experience with HTML/CSS/JS: </strong>I have a little experience using HTML/CSS/JS by taking object-oriented software and human-center design</li>
         <li><strong>One thing I hope to learn: </strong>I want to learn more how code design skills and rules that can make the web-page looks more innovative and creative.</li>
         <li><strong>Screen different from paper: </strong>I think designing on the screen requires more logic and calculation, rather than drawing on the paper, designing using code is editable and easier to make symmtric design</li>
         <li><strong>Effective design: </strong>
                <a href="//www.palmer-dinnerware.com/" target="_blank">palmer-dinnerware</a>
            I think this website have a very good personal style and clear website purpose when entering the website. The interaction is also very fluent and surprising. The main subject is highlighted by using bold text and light background.</li>
         <li><strong>Effective communication: </strong>
                <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA</a>
            I think NASA website have a very effective information communication desgin. Different types of content are seperate by using balck and white section and clear level of information hierarchy also helps direct viewer's attension around. 
         <li><strong>Works well website: </strong>
                <a href="https://www.instacart.com/store/" target="_blank">Instacart</a>
                I think this website has a high visual hierarchy level with navigation and key categories cleanly laid out. There is no other useless information, and the user flow is clear so users can easily navigate even if itâ€™s their first time.
