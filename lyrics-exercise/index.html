        <p>All I know is</p>
        <p>We could go anywhere, we could do</p>
        <p>Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in</p>
        <p>Yeah, all I know is</p>
        <p>Gettin' lost late at night, under stars</p>
        <p>Findin' love standin' right where we are, your lips</p>
        <p>They pull me in the moment</p>
        <p>You and I alone, and</p>
        <p>People may be watching</p>
        <p>I don't mind 'cause</p>
        <p>Anywhere with you feels right</p>
        <p>Anywhere with you feels like</p>
        <p>Paris in the rain</p>
        <p>Paris in the rain</p>

        <h2>chorus</h2>
        <p>We don't need a fancy town</p>
        <p>Or bottles that we can't pronounce</p>
        <p>'Cause anywhere, babe</p>
        <p>Is like Paris in the rain</p>
        <p>When I'm with you</p>
        <p>When I'm with you</p>
        <p>Paris in the rain</p>
        <p>Paris in the rain</p>

        <p>I look at you now and I want this forever</p>
        <p>I might not deserve it, but there's nothing better</p>
        <p>Don't know how I ever did it all without you</p>
        <p>My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest</p>
        <p>Feelings they come and they go, that they do</p>
        <p>Feelings they come and they go, not with you</p>
        <p>Late nights and the street lights</p>
        <p>And the people, look at me girl</p>
        <p>And the whole world could stop</p>
        <p>Anywhere with you feels right</p>
        <p>Anywhere with you feels like</p>
        <p>Paris in the rain</p>
        <p>Paris in the rain</p>

        <h2>chorus</h2>
        <p>We don't need a fancy town</p>
        <p>Or bottles that we can't pronounce</p>
        <p>'Cause anywhere, babe</p>
        <p>Is like Paris in the rain</p>
        <p>When I'm with you</p>
        <p>When I'm with you</p>
        <p>Paris in the rain</p>
        <p>Paris in the rain</p>

        <h2>bridge</h2>
        <p>Girl, when I'm not with you</p>
        <p>All I do is miss you</p>
        <p>So come and set the mood right</p>
        <p>Underneath the moonlight</p>
        <p>Days in Paris, nights in Paris</p>
        <p>Paint you with my eyes closed</p>
        <p>Wonder where the time goes</p>
        <p>Yeah, isn't it obvious? Isn't it obvious?</p>
        <p>Come and set the mood right</p>
        <p>Underneath the moonlight</p>

        <h2>outro</h2>
        <p>Anywhere with you feels right</p>
        <p>Anywhere with you feels like</p>
        <p>Paris in the rain</p>
        <p>Paris in the rain</p>
        <p>Walking down an empty street</p>
        <p>Puddles underneath our feet</p>
