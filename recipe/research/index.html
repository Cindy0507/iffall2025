      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>French toast comes out best if you work with thick slices of French or Italian loaf bread that are several days old. That way they've had a chance to firm up, which will make the slices hold up better when you dip them in the egg milk mixture and fry them. Thin slices of fresh bread tend to fall apart or get mushy when you do this, making for lousy French toast.</p>

    <section class="Ingredients">
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
        <li>8 thick slices 2-day-old bread (better if slightly stale)</li>
        <li>Butter (can sub vegetable oil)</li>
        <li>Maple syrup</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="Method">
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the egg mixture:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and cinnamon. Stir in the orange zest and/or triple sec if using. Whisk the mixture until well blended and pour into a shallow bowl, wide enough to place a slice of the bread you will be using.</li>
        <li><strong>Soak the bread slices in egg mixture:</strong>Place each slice of bread into the milk egg mixture, allowing the bread to soak in some of it.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the French toast:</strong>Melt some butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Shake off the excess egg mixture from the bread and place the bread slices onto the hot skillet. Fry the French toast until browned on one side, then flip and brown the other side.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Serve the French toast hot with butter, maple syrup, and/or fresh berries.</li>
      </ol>
